This folder contains all the neccesary code files for this paper. It has three sub-folders: Feature Extraction, Model Training and Model Evaluation.

Feature Extraction folder contains all the necessary code files to extract two types of features i.e. Behavioral and Textual, under all the three settings i.e. reviewer-centric, review-centric and product-centric for both the datasets i.e. YelpZip and YelpNYC. One more file i.e. "Computaion Time.py" contains the code for time computation comparision in feature extraction.

Model Training folder contains all the neccesary code files for model training by using three types of features i.e. Behavioral, Textual and Hybrid, under all the three settings i.e. reviewer-centric, review-centric and product-centric on both the datasets i.e. YelpZip and YelpNYC.

Model Evaluation folder contains all the necessary code files to evaluate the models trained using two types of features i.e. Behavioral and Textual, under all the three settings i.e. reviewer-centric, review-centric and product-centric on both the datasets i.e. YelpZip and YelpNYC.
